                    inclusive, non-intimidating environment. <br><br>Through the project, I aimed to create not just a
                    space for physical activities, but a community where people feel comfortable to push beyond their
                    insecurities. The content on the website was created to meet these needs by using motivating and
                    encouraging language to create an inclusive environment. I made Virtus to be a place where members
                    feel supported and welcomed.

                <p>The purpose of the website is to showcase the wide range of amenities offered and differentiate
                    ourselves from other fitness facilities. Our goal is to guide potential clients to sign-up for a
                    membership by showcasing the benefits of Virtus. As an anti big-box gym, we stand behind
                    authenticity and aim to create a welcoming environment that makes everyone feel supported no matter
                    where they stand in their fitness journey. Throughout the website we want to inspire confidence and
                    show that Virtus is more than just a gym - it’s a community focused on growth.

                    to spend the extra dollar for the quality of the facility and amenities. In addition, the secondary

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>To kickoff the project and ensure the success of Virtus, I started by conducting research involving
                    analyzing trends in the fitness market, identifying the key competitors, and understanding the needs
                    and preferences of our target audiences.
                    A persona was developed to better understand each of their needs, motivations, and pain points.
                    Additionally, an empathy map was created to help me capture their thoughts and feelings which helped
                    me to tailor the website’s content to two types of users.

                <h3>Identity</h3>
                <p>Virtus, inspired by the Latin virtue, came to mind when naming the company because it carries
                    meanings of excellence, valor, courage, and strength – aligning perfectly with the company’s values.
                    When designing the logo, I wanted to create something distinguishable. Initially, I experimented
                    with simple letter marks of V’s and T’s while incorporating a subtle and unique feature to make it
                    stand out. Though it may not be noticeable right away, I settled with a design that includes an old
                    fashion spartan helmet into each side of the letter symbolizing resilience and discipline and
                    perfectly ties the logo back to the origin of the name Virtus. </p>

                    Keyword Integration</h3>
                <p>At the beginning of the project, short and long-tailed keywords that potential customers would use on
                    a search engine were listed and later incorporated into the written content of the webpage mock-up.
                    As I developed the written content, I tried my best to make it as genuine as possible with some
                    personality and tone to account for the social pressures people face when going to the gym. Even
                    though the difference of this may be small, I believe it contributes to addressing for those
                    concerns to create a more inclusive environment.

                <p>As per the requirements of the project, the wireframing was initially created in Adobe InDesign. I
                    created a homepage, about us page, services, and an FAQ which were all essential pages for a fitness
                    facility. These were a good reference for the final prototype made on Figma, where I incorporated
                    components, used a design system and added a Memberships page.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>Designing the website mock-up for Virtus has been an amazing learning experience. While the project
                    primarily focused on content writing for targeted audiences, it also highlighted the importance of
                    addressing common design problems faced by Virtus' competitors. Being able to identify these pain
                    points and implementing a solution Virtus could further differentiate itself from competitors and
                    help the business stand out. <br><br>As I'm quite early on in my career, this project helped me
                    understand the difficulties of tying web design, content creation, and user-centric approaches all
                    together and although I'm proud of the work done for the project, there are numerous areas I'd hope
                    to expand on.</p>
